This is my final project for the Advanced CSS class for the fall 2023 term, The objective was to create a website to sell any product of our choosing with everything we learned in the course;
- forms
- color theory
- layout design
- responsiveness 
- semantic html
- css pseudo classes
- Javascript to Manipulate the DOM

I built an stunning website about snapchat's spectacles glasses.
